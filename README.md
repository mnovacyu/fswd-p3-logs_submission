# Logs Analysis Project
This project's goal is to build an internal reporting tool that will use infromation from a database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like.

## Python Script
The python script `solution.py` analyzes the news data base and answers the three following questions:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
1. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
1. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Usage
1. From within the vm, download the `solution.py` script
1. Run the script - `python3 solution.py`
1. A copy of the intended output is located in `solution_output.txt`
